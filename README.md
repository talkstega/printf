You will need to clone the repository of the project from Github. This will contain the _printf function and all of its dependencies. No main.c file will be provided for testing, so you will need to create one.

git clone https://github.com/talkstega/printf.git
After cloning the repository you will have a folder called printf. In here there will be several files that allow the function to work.
